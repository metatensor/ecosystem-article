**** DONE Energy weighted springs with MMF-NEB (RO-NEB)
CLOSED: [2025-08-12 Tue 14:10]
As implemented from [1] [[https://github.com/TheochemUI/eOn/pull/77][in EON]] (also [[https://github.com/TheochemUI/eOn/pull/230][here]]), using systems from [2].
- ASE is used to generate an initial IDPP path
*** TODO PLUMED
**** TODO LJ-38 free energy surface
Using a [[https://atomistic-cookbook.org/examples/metatomic-plumed/metatomic-plumed.html#histogram-of-coordination-numbers][histogram of coordination number]] based collective variable [3].

** FAQ
*** What's with the contributors list?
For maximum reproducibility, core tools are *vendored* with [[https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo][git-subrepo]]. This ensures (unlike submodules) that upstream changes cannot break downstream dependents.

However, it does create an inflated (but not technically incorrect) history. For the current contributors, consult the ~CODEOWNERS~ file.
