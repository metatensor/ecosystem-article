For *authors*, the following guidelines should be followed:
- Each folder should be structured as per the corresponding TeX guidelines
  + e.g. ~\section{Integrations}\subsection{eon}~ would be ~metatensor_integrations/eon~
- Remember to add the folder to the ~CODEOWNERS~ file [fn:: [[https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners][details here]]]
- The contents of the folder can be anything, as long as they can be used to reproducibly generate the figure
  + ~snakemake~ + custom ~pixi~ environments are an idea
    + As seen in the figures for ~eon~ and ~plumed~
